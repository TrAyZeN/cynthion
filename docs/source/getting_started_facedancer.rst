Using Cynthion with Facedancer
==============================

Together with `Facedancer <https://facedancer.readthedocs.io>`__,
Cynthion can be used to quickly and easily emulate USB devices controlled from Python running on the host computer.

Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed all steps in the :doc:`getting_started` section.


Install the Facedancer library
------------------------------

You can install the Facedancer library from the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/facedancer/>`__, a `release archive <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/Facedancer/releases>`__ or directly from `source <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/Facedancer/>`__.


Install From PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ tool to install the Facedancer library from PyPI using the following command:

.. code-block :: sh

    pip install facedancer

For more information on installing Python packages from PyPI please refer to the `"Installing Packages" <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/>`__ section of the Python Packaging User Guide.


Install From Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block :: sh

    git clone https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/facedancer.git
    cd facedancer/

Once you have the source code downloaded you can install the Facedancer library with:

.. code-block :: sh

    pip install .



Load Facedancer Bitstream and Firmware
--------------------------------------

You can run the Facedancer Bitstream and Firmware by running:

.. code-block :: sh

    cynthion run facedancer

You can verify that everything is working by running:

.. code-block :: sh

    cynthion info

You should see output like:

.. code-block :: sh

    Detected a Cynthion device!
        Bitstream: Facedancer (Cynthion Project)
        Hardware: Cynthion r1.4
        Flash UID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Connect Hardware

Make sure that the target host is running a program that can receive keyboard input such as a terminal or text editor and that it has focus.

Run a Facedancer example
------------------------

Create a new Python file called ``rubber-ducky.py`` with the following content:

.. literalinclude:: ../../cynthion/python/examples/facedancer-rubber-ducky.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

Open a terminal and run:

.. code-block :: sh

    python ./rubber-ducky.py

If all goes well, you should see the string ``hello, facedancer`` typed into the target host.

----------------
